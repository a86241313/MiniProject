            <p class="details">《Where's Wally》
                <br>
                It is a British series of children's puzzle books created by English illustrator Martin Handford.
                <br>
                The books consist of a series of detailed double-page spread illustrations depicting dozens or more
                people doing a variety of amusing things at a given location.
                <br>
                Readers are challenged to find a character named Wally hidden in the group.
                <br>
                Wally is identified by his red-and-white-striped shirt, bobble hat, and glasses, but many illustrations
                contain red herrings involving deceptive use of red-and-white striped objects.
                <br>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="details"> In 1986, Handford was asked by his art director at Walker Books to draw a character with
                peculiar
                features so that his pictures of crowds had a focal point.
                <br>
                After much thinking, he came up with the idea of "Wally", a world traveller and time travel aficionado
                who always dresses in red and white.
                <br>
                Sometimes it would take him up to eight weeks to draw a two-page sketch of the elusive "Wally" and the
                characters surrounding him.
                <br>
                The books became extremely popular and were localised for many different territories,
                <br>
                with name changes for Wally in certain regions.
                <br>
                The franchise also spawned other media in a more storyline-based form,
                <br>
                including a television series, a comic strip and a series of video games.

                <p class="details">In 1987's England,there's a serial killer，and he specially like to kill child 。
                    <br>
                    He has killed 25 children ,his modus operandi very cruel and he also good at hiding.
                    <br>
                    It took the police a long time to catch the suspect, but the murder was diagnosed as a psycho.
                    <br>
                    Therefore, he's placed in a mental hospital.
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately, the murderer escape from the hospital after several years and was wanted again.
                    <br>
                    But he disappeared without a trace,no one found him any after.
                    <br>
                    After the murderer escape, "Where is Willie?" is published,sooner.
                    <br>
                    It is said that the red and white striped clothes worn by Wally are the patient clothes he wore in
                    the mental hospital.
                    <br>
                    Hats, glasses and crutches are his transvesting tools;
                    <br>
                    Full of daily necessities and equipment is a necessity for his escape.
                    <br>
                    In order to hide Wally, there are Wally's Watchers in the picture book that specifically covers him.
                    <br>
                    The number of main Watchers is exactly the same as the number of children killed by Willie, both of
                    are 25 people.
                    <br>
                    Although the claim that Wally is a murderer is to be discussed to confirm,

                    <br>
                    the meaning of this picture book is intended to remind parents and children to be on the lookout for
                    people around,
                    <br>
                    because criminals may be around.
